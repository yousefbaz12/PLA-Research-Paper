**A comprehensive survey, experimental analysis, and future outlooks on leveraging deep learning to enhance physical-layer security in Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT) systems.**

This repository accompanies the research paper *"Deep Learning for Physical-Layer Security in Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT): A Survey, Experimental Analysis, and Outlooks"*. It provides code, datasets, research versions, proposal versions, high level architecture and prototype to explore and reproduce the application of deep learning (DL) techniquesâ€”such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)â€”to strengthen physical-layer security (PLS) in WIoT systems. The work addresses the growing security challenges in WIoT, driven by the proliferation of over 25 billion IoT devices by 2025, and proposes lightweight, adaptive solutions for resource-constrained environments.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Research Context
The Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT) integrates billions of low-power devicesâ€”sensors, actuators, and wearablesâ€”into modern infrastructure, enabling real-time data exchange in applications like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 4.0. However, the wireless mediumâ€™s inherent vulnerabilities expose WIoT to threats such as eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing. Traditional upper-layer cryptographic methods (e.g., RSA, AES) are computationally intensive and ill-suited for WIoTâ€™s resource constraints, prompting the exploration of PLS, which leverages physical channel properties like Channel State Information (CSI) and RF fingerprints.

### 1.2 Role of Deep Learning
DL enhances PLS by adapting to dynamic WIoT environments and detecting complex threats in real time. This survey reviews DL techniques from 2018-2025, provides experimental validation, and outlines future directions, including 6G integration and adversarial resilience. It bridges theoretical advancements with practical implementations, addressing gaps in prior studies like the lack of experimental evidence and narrow focus on authentication.
